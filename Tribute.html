<h2>A brief summary of Shivaji Maharaj</h2>
<h3>Early life</h3>
<p>
    Shivaji was born in the hill-fort of Shivneri, near the city of Junnar, which is now in Pune district.<br> Scholars disagree on his date of birth. The Government of Maharashtra lists 19 February as a holiday commemorating Shivaji's birth (Shivaji Jayanti).<br> Shivaji was named after a local deity, the goddess Shivai. Shivaji's father Shahaji Bhonsle was a Maratha general who served the Deccan Sultanates.<br> His mother was Jijabai the daughter of Lakhuji Jadhavrao of Sindhkhed,<br> a Mughal-aligned sardar claiming descent from a Yadav royal family of Devagiri.

<h3>Conflict with Bijapur sultanate</h3>
<p>
    In 1646, 16-year-old Shivaji took the Torna Fort, taking advantage of the confusion prevailing in the Bijapur court due to the ailment of Sultan Mohammed Adil Shah, and seized the large treasure he found there.<br> In the following two years, Shivaji took several important forts near Pune, including Purandar, Kondhana and Chakan. Also, he brought areas east of Pune around Supa, Baramati and Indapur <br>under his direct control. He used the treasure found at Torna to build a new fort named Rajgad.<br>That fort served as the seat of his government for over a decade.After this, Shivaji turned west to the Konkan and took possession of the important town of Kalyan. <br>Bijapur government took note of these happenings and sought to take action. <br>On 25 July 1648, Shahaji was imprisoned by a fellow Maratha sardar called, Baji Ghorpade under the orders of Bijapur government, in a bid to contain Shivaji.[32]
